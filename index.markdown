## <span style="color:#556B2F">About Me

I’m a Ph.D. student in MIT EECS, advised by [Caroline Uhler](https://www.carolineuhler.com). My research focuses on establishing statistical and algorithmic foundations for discovery and decision-making within systems created by underlying causal rules. In particular, I develop tools to understand causal relationships from data, model and extrapolate to predict the effects of interventions, and select informative interventions for experimental design. Motivated by problems in cell biology, these tools help accelerate mechanistic discovery and translation to biomedical engineering.

My research has been supported by the [Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center PhD Fellowship](https://www.ericandwendyschmidtcenter.org/graduate-students) and the [Apple Scholarship](https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/apple-scholars-aiml-2023). I was a research intern at [Byedance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/resources/offices/5e429e0805204d81e5b45c92), [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project_azua/overview/), and [Apple](https://www.apple.com/careers/us/work-at-apple/seattle.html). I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Peking University, where I worked with [Zaiwen Wen](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/), [Mengdi Wang](https://mwang.princeton.edu), and [Le Cong](http://clbiology.com/index.html).
